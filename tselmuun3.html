`My love,

Sometimes, I think life is so strange and beautiful…
How, out of all the billions of people walking on this planet,
out of all the roads I could've taken,
out of all the hearts I could've crossed paths with…

it was you that my heart chose.

And every day I understand more and more why.
You have this quiet softness in you.
this soft magic,

this warmth that feels like home.
even on days when everything else feels cold.

You don’t even try —
you just exist.
and somehow you make my soul feel safe.

I love how your smile melts my entire world.
I love the way your voice calms storms inside me I never talk about.
I love the way you make me feel seen and understood and loved.

in a way nobody else ever has.

You don't know how special you are.
You don't know how much light you carry.
You don't know how deeply you've already changed my life.
just by being in it.
And maybe I'll spend a lifetime trying to show you.
Because loving you has never felt like a decision —

It felt like breathing.
Natural.
Easy.
Automatic.
Something my heart already knew how to do
Long before my mind realized it.
I think about our future sometimes —

not in a dreamy, unrealistic way.
but in a warm, quiet way.
I imagine waking up next to you,
your messy morning hair.
your sleepy eyes.

your soft voice saying "good morning."
I imagine us cooking together,
and haggling over who gets to stir the pot.
you stealing bites,

me feigning not to see.
I imagine late-night talks.
warm hugs from behind,
your head on my chest,
our fingers intertwined,

our laughter echoing in our little home.
I envision us traveling.
seeing places we always dreamed of,
getting lost in cities we don’t know,
but never feeling lost
because we have each other.

I imagine growing old with you.
our hair turning silver.
our backs bending,
our hands still holding.
our hearts still speaking the same soft language

they do right now.
Because you…
you're the one I'd love to go through life with.
The quiet moments.
The loud ones.
The beautiful ones.
The difficult ones.
All of it.

I want to be there for your successes and your failures.
for your happiest days and your darkest nights.
I wanna be somebody you can lean on without fear,
someone who listens,
someone who supports,
one who stays.

You don't have to be perfect with me.
You don’t have to hide.
You don't have to act.
You can be soft,
you can be scared,
you can be tired,
you can be you —

and I'd still choose you
every single time.
Thank you…

for being the only one who makes me feel alive. 
For being the one who keeps me so calm. 
For being the one person I look forward to talking to. 
For being the person my heart returns to again and again 
You know and understands it without any hesitation.

 I love you, in ways I haven’t fully learned how to explain. 
 I love you in ways that stretch beyond the simple “I love you.”
  I love you to the core. with sincerity, with tenderness, with a devotion that grows quietly but fiercely. 
  I love you just the way you are. for who you've been, and for who you're becoming. 
  And I hope, with all my heart, that you feel even a small piece of the love.
  I carry for you. 
  
  Yours forever,
   Your dummy💌`;
